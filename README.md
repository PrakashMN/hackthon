 Project Brief
Project Overview
 Create a web app for generating data visualizations using AI. Users can sign 
in with Google to access the main screen. The UI features a two-step wizard. 
In the first step, the user inputs a prompt to generate the chart; in the next 
step, users can customize titles, colors, and legends, and export visualizations 
as code or images. Feel free to adapt this concept to suit your design needs.
 Create a pie chart showing the voter percentage for the Democratic and 
Republican parties in the 2024 US elections. Use the following data:
 •	Democratic Party: 52%
 •	Republican Party: 48%
